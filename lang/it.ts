    <translation>$appname is Fairware, which means &quot;open source software developed with expectation of fair contributions from users&quot;. Hours have been invested in this software with the expectation that users will be fair enough to compensate them. The &quot;Unpaid hours&quot; figure you see below is the hours that have yet to be compensated for this project.
    
If you like this application, please make a contribution that you consider fair. Thanks!

    <translation>You won't or you can't contribute? I'm sure you have valid reasons, but I think I also have valid reasons for asking for contributions. Please, let me know what you think. I promise you right here right now that anything reasonable will get you a registration key.</translation>
